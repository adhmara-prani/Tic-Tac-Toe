# Tic Tac Toe

I have made this not-so-good-looking tic tac toe via `Html`, `css` and `Javascript` that requires a lot of finishing as of yet. I'm thinking of implementing a leaderboard as well but it may be above and beyond my capabilites.

# Hi, I'm Parth! 👋

I just tried my best making this project and this is my first upload on github. I have made this repository open for whoever that is reading this to give me tips on how i can improve this project.

**ENOUGH ABOUT THIS PROJECT!!!**

Let us talk about me. I have some experience in HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT and look forward to expand my tech stack as I will start learning REACT.JS and other such frameworks as soon as I'm done with mini-projects/ beginner-friendly projects such as this.
